# Digital-Clock

I thought of designing a GUI inspired by the mobile clock application. It has got four features:

1. Alarm: It takes time in a 24-hour format and rings a tune on striking its given time. I have used the concept of threading and subprocess to check the current time with the given time and to ring a tune. In the meantime, it displays the given time and time left to ring the bell in the hour, minute, and second format.

2. Time Clock: It displays the current time in a 24-hours format with the second count.

3. Stopwatch: We have the format of HH: MM: SS display which increases per second with the click of the Start button. We can pause the stopwatch and reset the display to its original format.

4. Timmer: We can set the timer at a maximum of 99 Hours, 59 Minutes, and 59 Seconds. We pause the timer for an infinite time and can also reset the timer.

The project consists of the concept of GUI, OOPs, Threading, Subprocess, and Time.
